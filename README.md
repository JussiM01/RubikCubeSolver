# Rubik's cube solver
My initial thought was to make program which learns to solve the Rubik's cube on it's own. Since this is more of a research problem that requires some thinking, I decided to first write a program which teaches the user to solve the cube by using basic beginners method on example cubes.

##TODO:
-Finish the implementation of beginners method (almost ready)
-Make a GUI
