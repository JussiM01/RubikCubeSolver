# Rubik's cube solver

**Background**

My initial thought was to make program that learns to solve the Rubik's cube on its own. Since this is more of a research problem and requires some thinking, I decided to first write a program that teaches the user to solve the cube by using basic beginners method on example cubes.

**How to use**

Download or clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/JussiM01/RubikCubeSolver.git

Go to the Solver directory:

  cd RubikCubeSolver/Solver/

Run the script rubik_ui.py with python 3.x:

  python3 rubik_ui.py
  
The program will ask the user to choose between giving a configuration of the cube or allowing the program to give one for the user. Then it will give instructions for solving the cube. Rotations are represented with the same symbols as in the *[official 3X3 Rubik's cube solving guide.](https://eu.rubiks.com/solve-it/3x3/)*
