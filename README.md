# Rubik's cube solver
My initial thought was to make program that learns to solve the Rubik's cube on its own, since this is more of a research problem and requires some thinking, I decided to first write a program that teaches the user to solve the cube by using basic beginners method on example cubes.

##TODO:
-Finish the implementation of beginners method (almost ready)  
-Make a GUI
